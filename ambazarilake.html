        Ambazari Lake is among Nagpur's 11 lakes and is one of the largest. This lake is the primary water supply
        for<br>
        government officials and other influential individuals. In addition, the Nag River originates in this
        lake.<br><br>

        The garden next to Ambazari Lake, one of the major tourist attractions of Nagpur, has been transformed into a
        more<br>
        memorable destination to visit, with a musical fountain, amusement activities, and several electric rides.
        Ambazari<br>
        Lake also has boating facilities and a specially planned walking route. These amenities make Ambazari Lake a
        must-,<br>
        see destination and it has thus become a popular tourist destination throughout the holiday season.<br><br>

        The water from Ambazari Lake is distributed through clay pipes constructed in 1870 under the reign of Bhosle. It
        was<br>
        built to provide water to the entire city of Nagpur. It was given the name Ambazari because mango trees flank
        it.<br><br>

        Tourists can enjoy boating, games, and rides and visit several pubs and restaurants, one of which is the
        Dwelling
        bar<br>
        and Restaurants. The garden, which spans 25 acres and is next to the lake, is the icing on the cake. If you are
        a
        nature<br>
        enthusiast, you will not want to miss the abundance of flora and fauna found here.<br><br>
