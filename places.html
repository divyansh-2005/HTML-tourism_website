  <h2>PLACES TO VISIT IN NAGPUR</h2>
  Hereâ€™s a list of must visit places in Nagpur, Maharashtra:
  <h2>01. <a href="Deekshabhoomi.html" target="_blank">Deekshabhoomi</a></h2>
  <img src="images/de.jpg" width="640" height="320">
  <p>
    The stupa, also called Dhamma Chakra, is a magnificent architectural structure that can hold more than 5,000
    people.<br>
    The Deekshabhoomi, a Buddhist holy monument, is one of India's most well-known Buddhist pilgrimage centres. The<br>
    Deekshabhoomi, a significant tourist destination, was created where Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the father of the<br>
    Indian constitution, and his 60,000 supporters converted to Buddhism on October 14, 1956.
    <br><br>
    Every year, countless Buddhist devotees visit this site, with the number increasing dramatically on Mass
    Conversion<br>
    Ceremony Day, also known as Dhamma Chakra Parivartan Din. Deekshabhoomi is Asia's largest stupa, and it attracts
    Buddhists<br>
    from all over the world.
    <br><br>
    The phrases' Deeksha' and 'Bhoomi' were combined to form the word 'Deekshabhoomi.' This signifies that<br>
    Deekshabhoomi is the place where Buddhists are ordained. Such a large-scale conversion in one location was <br>
    unprecedented in human history. Ram Dham is a lovely landscape located only two kilometres from Deekshabhoomi.

  <h2>02. <a href="ambazarilake.html" target="_blank">Ambazari Lake</a></h2>
  <img src="images/ambazarilake.jpg" width="640" height="320" />
  <p>
    Ambazari Lake is among Nagpur's 11 lakes and is one of the largest. This lake is the primary water supply for<br>
    government officials and other influential individuals. In addition, the Nag River originates in this lake.<br><br>

    The garden next to Ambazari Lake, one of the major tourist attractions of Nagpur, has been transformed into a
    more<br>
    memorable destination to visit, with a musical fountain, amusement activities, and several electric rides.
    Ambazari<br>
    Lake also has boating facilities and a specially planned walking route. These amenities make Ambazari Lake a
    must-see destination,<br>
    and it has thus become a popular tourist destination throughout the holiday season.<br><br>

    The water from Ambazari Lake is distributed through clay pipes constructed in 1870 under the reign of Bhosle. It
    was<br>
    built to provide water to the entire city of Nagpur. It was given the name Ambazari because mango trees flank
    it.<br><br>

    Tourists can enjoy boating, games, and rides and visit several pubs and restaurants, one of which is the Dwelling
    bar<br>
    and Restaurants. The garden, which spans 25 acres and is next to the lake, is the icing on the cake. If you are a
    nature<br>
    enthusiast, you will not want to miss the abundance of flora and fauna found here.<br><br>

  <h2>
    04.
    <a href="SitabuldiFort.html" target="_blank">Sitabuldi Fort</a>
  </h2>
  <img src="images/SitabuldiFort.jpg" width="640" height="320">
  <p>
    This fort is one of Nagpur's most popular attractions and an excellent place to visit. The fort is perched on a
    hill, and<br>
    it was here that the Battle of Sitabuldi took place in 1817. In the year 1702, Raja Bhakth Buland Sahin constructed
    the fort.<br>
    It was the Third Anglo-Maratha War battleground between the kings of Nagpur and the British.<br><br>

    #Trivia: It is one of Maharashtra's oldest forts.<br><br>

    You will find a chamber where Mahatma Gandhi was imprisoned in the fort's showpiece. In addition, there is a <br>
    military memorial honouring soldiers who died in the conflict. It is presently only open to the public on national
    <br>
    holidays such as Independence Day and Republic Day. Weapons and ammunition used by historical kings and emperors
    <br>
    can also be examined here. There are also exclusive items from the Indian Army on display.<br><br>
  </p>
  <h2>
    05.
    <a href="FutalaLake.html" target="_blank">Futala Lake</a>
  </h2>
  <img src="images/FutalaLake.jpg" width="640" height="320">
  <p>
    Futala Lake is one of the eleven lovely and scenic lakes in Nagpur. It is also recognized as the Telankhedi Lake,
    and it's<br>
    located on Nagpur's western outskirts, some 6 kilometres from the city centre.<br><br>

    Futala Lake, a 200-year-old lake with a surface area of 60 acres, was established by Raja Bhosle. It's the perfect
    place<br>
    for you and your spouse to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life. Even a simple walk along the path might
    <br>
    be enthralling while watching the sunset. Evenings at Futala Lake with your loved one become even more memorable
    <br>
    with the addition of three fountains.<br><br>

    Two 15-foot-high coloured fountains and one 100-foot-high fountain are other prominent tourist attractions in the
    area. <br>
    Not only that but on the lake's southern shore is an immersion ghat, where visitors can take a dip in the lagoon's
    icy waters.<br><br>

    In the area, there are also several vendors selling mouth-watering local foods. Places along the lake's shores are
    also <br>
    worth seeing, and many people visit these hotels for dinner after enjoying time with family and friends. You can
    also <br>
    enjoy some corn while riding in a tonga (horse carriage). A romantic evening at one of the lakefront restaurants
    serves <br>
    as an ideal date night for most couples.<br><br>
