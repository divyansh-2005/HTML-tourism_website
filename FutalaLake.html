        Futala Lake is one of the eleven lovely and scenic lakes in Nagpur. It is also recognized as the Telankhedi
        Lake,
        and it's<br>
        located on Nagpur's western outskirts, some 6 kilometres from the city centre.<br><br>

        Futala Lake, a 200-year-old lake with a surface area of 60 acres, was established by Raja Bhosle. It's the
        perfect
        place<br>
        for you and your spouse to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life. Even a simple walk along the path
        might
        <br>
        be enthralling while watching the sunset. Evenings at Futala Lake with your loved one become even more memorable
        <br>
        with the addition of three fountains.<br><br>

        Two 15-foot-high coloured fountains and one 100-foot-high fountain are other prominent tourist attractions in
        the
        area. <br>
        The lake's southern shore is an immersion ghat, where visitors can take a dip in the
        lagoon's
        icy waters.<br><br>

        In the area, there are also several vendors selling mouth-watering local foods. Places along the lake's shores
        are
        also <br>
        worth seeing, and many people visit these hotels for dinner after enjoying time with family and friends. You can
        also <br>
        enjoy some corn while riding in a tonga (horse carriage). A romantic evening at one of the lakefront restaurants
        serves <br>
        as an ideal date night for most couples.<br><br>
